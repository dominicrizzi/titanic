# Titanic Kaggle Competition

I believe that immersing yourself in the Titanic dataset is one of the best challenges that a beginner in data science can do.
This is why I bring a two part Medium Article written by myself about this dataset. 
In the first one, you can find a brief but solid data exploration and cleaning. 
While in the second one, I will write about algorithms used. The best part of this dataset, is you can use almost every Algorithm!!
We will use some supervised Learning and some unsupervised to see its results predicting if a person survived or not the titanic accident.
